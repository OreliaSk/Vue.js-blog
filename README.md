This app will allow you to edit and post articles on your blog. Test it !
For running the app, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) npm version 3+ and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Use those commands to generate node-modules &co (using vue-cli).
